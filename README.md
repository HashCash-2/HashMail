> Crypto-economic protocol to have better public communication tools

## Introduction

Any open public communication forum created by an individual is always spammed by people. E-mail service is the most abused. It forces people whose time is valuable to not check their inbox because it has a million emails with only a handful of them as useful to the individual. This spoils things for people who want to reach this individual for geneuine purposes and totally spoils the purpose of having an email account. 

We want to make these public communication tools **spam resistant** and using economics **bubble up things that matter to the individual**
